# Multitemporal Sampling Module for Real-Time Human Activity Recognition (MTS-ConvNet)

## Abstract

This program (MTS-ConvNet) is designed to perform the real-time human activity recognition. The MTS-ConvNet includes a multi-temporal sampling module that allows the neural networks to consider multiple sampling intervals simultaneously.

This software is a PyTorch implementation of the proposed method. The original version of this program was written by Jaegyun Park. You can find detailed information in our manuscript.
